    <h2>  World of Wonders</h2>


<p> <strong>South Asia</strong> has seen a meteoric rise in the popularity of gaming,<br> and its acceptance into the mainstream 
of the everyday person. <br>The Battle Royale revolution will be notched down in the history of esports<br> as the
 trigger that forced both gaming and <br>esports through the wall of culture it found itself knocking against 
repeatedly.</P>

<h4>
<p> In the ups and downs of life, some forces of life keep us moving,<br> in the darkest hour of every night,<br>z there is 
always a candle, burning midnight oils to enlighten the darkness and prepare to welcome the glim and glow of
 morning, In fall, there <br>is a nightingale who sings euphonious songs along with the mesmerizing melodious sound
 of falling leaves and keep on reminding the life around<br> him that this season is a preparation for hosting new life. 
These are the answers to the questions people often ask me about my love,<br> dedication, and support for Imran khan and faith in his abilities as a leader. 
 My devotion is a two-layered phenomenon; spiritual and political,  <br> based upon the different arguments and their
 relation to the different aspects of life. It may not be the case with everyone<br> but those who are spiritually
 minded and has an idealistically realistic approach towards life and who want their <br>names to be written on the
 golden pages of history and be remembered after their death as those to whom humanity<br> could look up in the age
 of turmoil and disaster. 



 <strong>First among the two </strong>layers is the <em>spiritual </em>one which is way stronger and bonded with the soul.<br> Imran Khan has
 always been a wanderer of spirituality which, as he has mentioned in his book, <br>has empowered him to tackle down 
the challenges of life and provided him with a new and different way of looking at life.<br> I feel a spiritual 
connection with him because in every spell of depression, in each attack of anxiety,<br> and in the nights of despair,
 I found his words and life a torch of light and beacon of hope. <br>The way he made it back to the cricket and touched
 the highest skies after the worst performance<br> in his very debut test match was always a magnet of success in my
 every failure. His decision to be a fast bowler even after<br> the negative remarks and judgments of both public and
 experts and then proving them wrong with his unshakable determination and <br>unbreakable confidence, was there for me
 to look at each time while doing something that everyone told me I would not be able to make it.<br> The epitome of service to humanity, 
the class of devotedness, </p>
